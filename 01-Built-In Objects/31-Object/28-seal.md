```js
const object1 = {
  property1: 42
};

Object.seal(object1);
object1.property1 = 33;
console.log(object1.property1);
// expected output: 33

delete object1.property1; // cannot delete when sealed
console.log(object1.property1); // 33
```

## Syntax:
`Object.seal(obj)`

* **obj**: The `object` which should be sealed.

## Return value:
The `object` being sealed.

---

## Description:
The `Object.seal()` method seals an `object`, preventing new properties from being added to it and marking all existing properties as non-configurable.  Values of present properties can still be changed as long as long as they are writable.

By default, `objects` are extensible (new properties can be added to them). Sealing an `object` prevents new properties from being added and marks all existing properties as non-configurable. This has the effect of making the set of properties on the `object` fixed and immutable. Making all properties non-configurable also prevents them from being converted from data properties to accessor properties and vice versa, but it does not prevent the values of data properties from being changed. Attempting to delete or add properties to a sealed `object`, or to convert a data property to accessor or vice versa, will fail, either silently or by throwing a `TypeError` (most commonly, although not exclusively, when in `strict` mode code).

The prototype chain remains untouched. However, the `__proto__` property is sealed as well.
